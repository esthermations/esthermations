Hello, I like graphics and embedded and know a thing or two about safety-critical. No more than two things, though.

I also like learning programming languages. I once wrote a Project Euler solution [in Latin](https://github.com/esthermations/ProiectumEuleri/blob/master/Problema01.pl). Nice to meet ya!
